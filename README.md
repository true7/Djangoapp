Behold my little, but proud enough web-application, written in Django. Yes, it can leave a lot to be desired. But be sure - the work is still in progress. And as soon as it possible I will  improve it.



To have a look at blog's work, you need to know:

python version = 3.5
django version = 1.9

You can browse the work of the blog here: antiblog.pythonanywhere.com

if you don't want to create your own user, login as one of them:
ss
12345678                 - ordinary user

anna
12345678                 - superuser

They have much different permissions.
